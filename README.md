# 🛒Finn-scraper for real estate

### Plans:
Will mainly use it for finding an apartment.
Continue development by adding:
<ul>
  <li>🔄 Backend in Python, and make a frontend using React</li>
  <li>📊 Charts and databases</li>
  <li>🗺️ A map for displaying where the apartments are located</li>
  <li>✅ Web interface that is easy to use and powerful</li>
  <li>🔮 Eventually make it possible to use the program for more than apartments</li>
</ul>
